# CloudIOServer

This is the product of the bachelorproject Sofus WÃ¼rtz and I are undergoing in the spring of 2019 at the faculty of CS, AU, Denmark.
This is the serverside of a client <-> server filedepository, which is meant to contain encrypted files clients upload.
Has had inspiration from similar concepts, such as dropbox and spideroak.
